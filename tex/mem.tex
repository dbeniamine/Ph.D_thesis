\chapter{Memory Performance Analysis}

The results of our case study (\chap{perf}) showed that traditional performance analysis tools can help identify memory related performance issues.
Yet they are not able to tell precisely where (in terms of data structures) the issue occurs and thus it is still required to analyze manually the code.

This chapter presents discuss memory analysis, first we present the specificities of recent memory subsystems in \sect{archi} and the usual mistakes that can generate performances drop in \sect{usual-issues}.
Finally we present existing performance analysis tools related to memory in \sect{mem-tools} and describe how we could improve these tools in \sect{mem-cncl}.
